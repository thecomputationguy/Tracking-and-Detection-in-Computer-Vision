This is a working version of the Decision Tree based classifier. The entire pipline is functional but the results are not the best. Need to play around with training parameters.

To run:

1. Download the Decision Trees directory.
2. Unzip the images.zip to the same folder.
3. run 'cmake .' (without quotes and note the ".").
4. run 'make' (without quotes).
5. run ./dt

Note: C++11 standard support required as the "tuple" library isn't available in c++98. This has already been set in the Cmake file but is good to know.
